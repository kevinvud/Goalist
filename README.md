### Description

Welcome to Goalist! This app allows user to add goal and keep track of it until it's completed. Every goal has two variables. One is completion point, and the other one is starting point. The starting point is always 0 and the completion point is from whatever the point that the user assigns to it. The user keeps track of the goal by adding 1 to starting point and when starting point is equal to completion point, user's goal is completed. 

For example: User creates a goal which he/she names it "Make an iOS app," and assigns 5 point to it. From now on, the user will keep track of the goal by adding point to it and when he adds 5 point to the goal, the goal is completed because his completion goal is now equal to his starting goal.

### App Features:
